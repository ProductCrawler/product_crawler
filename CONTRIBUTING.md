# How to Contribute

## Step 1 - Selecting a Product
Find a product to insert to the database. Make sure that the specific product hasn't been already entered, by checking the pull requests
that have been made by other users. The products may vary in type. Some examples of product types are: Food, drinks & beverages, 
dental hygiene products, beauty products, etc.

## Step 2 - Finding Product Info
Once you have found the item of your choice there are two valid ways you can locate its product information.

a) You can find it on the product's label or

b) You can find it on an official product website.
   Some useful websites are listed below: 
   
   http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/
   
   http://www.marschocolate.com.au/products/mars/mars-bar-36g/
   
## Step 3 - Recording Product Info
Open the product_info_template.txt. (https://github.com/ProductCrawler/product_crawler/blob/master/product_info_template.txt)

All the product information needed to be recorded and its format is found in this text file.

Please maintain the format in which the information is written down in the text, as changing it might be a case of invalid contribution.

## Step 4 - Making a Pull Request
To make a PR you will need two files, a text file and a png file.

The text file you will need to submit is the one described in Step 3. Name the file product_name.txt, for example if you chose
the Honey Cheerios cereal the file would be honey_cheerios.txt 

The png file is a picture of the product's information. This can be either a clear picture of the product's label or a screenshot
of the product information from an official product website.  Name the second file product_name.png, so for the previews example it 
would have been honey_cheerios.png

Put the two files into a folder named with the following format: "Product Name (distributed country(ies), date inserted)" and make your Pull Request.
Example: "Honey Cheerios (U.S.A., Germany, France, 29.09.17)"

You are ready to go.
