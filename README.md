# Product Crawler

## Welcome
Hello, thank you for taking the time to check out our Open Source Project!! We count on your contributions to transform this project into 
a significant service.

## What is the Product Crawler?
Inspired by Hippocrates' quote: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” and by the more current one: "We are what we eat", we 
made the Product Crawler. 
This open source project aims on creating a database that stores important information about everyday products (it initially concerned 
only food, edible products). Product information such as the ingredients, the nutritional value, preservatives, family companies etc.

## PROJECT GOAL 
Our goal is to integrate the database into a website (currently on https://productcrawler.wixsite.com/home and on our new app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appeiro.productcrawler) that can be used by anybody to check the QUALITY of the products in the market. It is
our RIGHT as consumers to have easy access to the knowledge of what we eat, what we drink, what we put on our face and hair...
But to achieve this in a scale that is big enough for the database to be considered useful and practical, we count on your contributions
to this open source project.
